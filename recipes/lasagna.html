    <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This tasty lasagna was made by layering  tender chunks of steamed Maine lobster with pasta, jarred or homemade Alfredo sauce, fresh spinach, and three types of cheese: ricotta, Cheddar, and Parmesan. Serve with a tossed garden salad and oven-toasted garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo pasta sauce</li>
                <li>16 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>2 pounds cooked and cubed lobster meat</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach leaves</li>
             </ul>        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

                <li>Place ricotta cheese into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and eggs. Mix in onion, parsley, garlic, and pepper.</li>

                <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups Alfredo sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of 4 lasagna noodles. Arrange 1/3 of the lobster meat over noodles, then cover with 1/3 of the spinach and another layer Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers twice more: noodles, lobster meat, spinach, and sauce. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan over top. Give the whole pan a gentle shake to get everything settled in.</li>

                <li>Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until cheese is browned, about 10 more minutes.</li>

                <li>Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>

             </ol>
